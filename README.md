easyGestures N is a WebExtension (written for Firefox) that provides easy to learn gestures for browsing the Web through a highly customizable pie menu.

Click the middle mouse button (or the left mouse button and a 'Shift' key on a Mac) to open the pie menu, then click on the action to execute. Or even faster, hold down that button, drag the mouse pointer over the action to execute and release the button. Customize the actions available on the pie menu in the preferences dialog. Check out other features in the tips.

This extension is a fork of version 4.3.2 of the easyGestures Firefox extension created by Ons Besbes, who maintained it until Firefox 4. Help is very much welcome, especially for updating and maintaining the formerly supported locales: cz-CZ, de-DE, hu-HU, it-IT, ja-JP, ko-KR, pl-PL, pt-BR, sk-SK, tr-TR, zh-CN and zh-TW. Their corresponding strings can be found under the [v4.13 extension/chrome/locale folder](https://github.com/ngdeleito/easyGestures/tree/v4.13/extension/chrome/locale).

To install the latest development version:

- Make sure to run version 5.2 or greater (or uninstall any previous version)
- Click on the button labeled "Code", and then click on "Download ZIP"
- Once the file downloaded, unzip it
- Zip the content of the "easyGestures-development/extension" folder (and not the folder itself!)
- Drop the zipped file into either Firefox Developer Edition or Firefox Nightly (make sure that the "xpinstall.signatures.required" preference in about:config is "false")
