    - fixed actions: "View Page Source", "Show Only This Frame", and "Paste"
    - "Cut", "Copy" and "Paste" actions can appear again as disabled (with some limitations)
    - removed actions: "Autoscrolling", "View Page Info", "Focus Location Bar", "Quit", "Restart", "Firefox Preferences", "Add-ons", "Undo", and "Redo"

    - the pie menu can again be opened inside a frame, and "Page Top" and "Page Bottom" actions work again inside frames
    - the custom icon URL for "Run Script" actions needs to be manually provided in the preferences dialog through a text input box
    - favicons cannot be retrieved nor displayed
    - removed support for upgrading from versions prior to 5.2
- new actions: "Copy Page URL", "Copy URL to Identifier", "Move Tab to New Window", "Load URL in New Private Window", "Bookmark this Identifier", "Remove Bookmark to this Page", "Remove Bookmark to this Identifier", and "Remove Bookmark to this Link"
- improved code dealing with preferences and code running in content scripts


Version 5.2 (June 8, 2017)

- migrated most of the extension to an embedded WebExtension
- limitations due to the migration to a WebExtension:
    - the pie menu can only be opened on pages whose location starts with "http://", "https://" (except https://addons.mozilla.org/), and "file://" and "about:blank" (with limitations, as some actions do not work on these type of pages)
    - it is currently not possible to perform a cleanup operation when the extension is disabled; reenabling the extension afterwards might require explicitly reloading pages to reset the internal state of the pie menu on those pages
    - the pie menu cannot (currently) be opened inside a frame
    - the following actions can no longer appear as disabled: "Back", "Forward", "Cut", "Copy", and "Paste"
    - it does not seem to be possible to migrate the following actions (they currently appear as disabled and will normally be removed in the next version of the extension): "Back Site", "First Page", "Forward Site", "Last Page", "Home Page", "Autoscrolling", "Toggle Find Bar", "View Page Source", "View Page Info", "Show Only This Frame", "Focus Location Bar", "Search Web", "Quit", "Restart", "Show Bookmarks", "Toggle Bookmarks Sidebar", "Toggle Bookmarks Toolbar", "Show History", "Toggle History Sidebar", "Show Downloads", "Firefox Preferences", "Add-ons", "Copy Image", "Undo", and "Redo"
    - "New Blank Tab" action no longer gives focus to the location bar
    - "New Window" action became an alias of "New Blank Window"
    - "Bookmark This Page" action appears disabled if the page is already bookmarked
    - "Bookmark This Link" and "Bookmark Open Tabs" actions do no longer open a popup for user interaction
    - the URL of custom icons for "Run Script" actions is displayed in place of the icon itself in the preferences dialog
    - "Paste" action is temporarily broken
    - autoscrolling through the pie menu center no longer works (as WebExtensions create “untrusted” events)
- "Reload" action only reloads now the current tab
- replaced the last XUL-based control in the preferences dialog (the one for customizing the "Daily Readings" action folder) with an HTML-based control; the corresponding preference needs to be manually reset
- custom tooltips for "Load URL" and "Run Script" actions are now only displayed on the pie menu
- stats by direction are now updated when the extra menu is shown
- stats are automatically refreshed while the preferences dialog is open


Version 5.1 (January 8, 2017)

- replaced (most of) XUL-based preferences dialog with an HTML-based page
- merged the stats dialog into the preferences dialog
- redesigned the control for customizing menu layouts and the clicks by direction stats tab
- properly fixed closeTab action in Firefox 50+ (thanks to Gijs Kruitbosch!)


Version 5.0 (October 11, 2016)

- fixed issues:
    - when using autoscrolling through the pie menu center the autoscrolling control appeared at the last clicked location instead of at the pie menu center (thanks gamingexpert13 for reporting!)
    - closeTab action did not always work in Firefox 50+
- replaced XUL-based tips and stats dialogs with HTML-based pages
- got rid of DTD localization files
- minor improvements in the tips, stats and preferences dialogs


Version 4.14 (July 14, 2016)

- exporting and importing preferences is again possible (importing is however backwards incompatible with the file format used by the original easyGestures)
- removed items:
    - iconless menus
    - no longer supported locales (cz-CZ, de-DE, hu-HU, it-IT, ja-JP, ko-KR, pl-PL, pt-BR, sk-SK, tr-TR, zh-CN and zh-TW)
    - support for upgrading from versions prior to 4.8
- fixed issues:
    - Firefox's context menu was incorrectly shown when the right mouse button was used to display an alternative menu
    - custom icons for the loadURL and runScript actions were displayed even if this led to mixed context
    - upgrading required disabling and reenabling the extension

- fixed issues:
    - display of disabled loadURL and runScript icons in small menus
    - the pie menu could not always be opened because a key was incorrectly considered as being pressed (this results in a reduced number of key options both for preventing the opening of the pie menu and for opening the contextual menu)

        - autoscrolling no longer interferes with the pie menu if the middle mouse button is used to open the menu
